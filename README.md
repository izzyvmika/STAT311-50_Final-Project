# STAT311-50_Final-Project


Group 5 (Mika, Izzy)...     -    This is the JMP Journal. It has Models 1 - 3 (bottom), and distributions and scatterplot graphs at the top (demonstrate the Charges distribution being mostly normalized by transformY, interactions of BMIxSmoker, and potential interaction of more combinations of factors (inconclusive).

.jrp Files      -      Model 4 was a potential improved model. Not used in final results / conclusion, but I think is useful as a pointer of where we could improve Model 3 if we worked on this dataset again. (group by color) shows the Models' results if you look at each group separately. This is how I noticed they partly respond to different factors / interactions, might need different transformations of Y, etc (if looking at Model 2 (group by color), the different groups have different box-cox lambda values).
